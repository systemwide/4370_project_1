Purpose: To learn more about queries by implementing basic 
	query functions in Java.
______________________________________________________________

In this project, we created basic Java implementations of the 
following operations:

 - Select (including simple select, using a predicate string,
 	and with a primary key)
 - Project
 - Union
 - Minus
 - Join (including equi join and natural join)


For compiling the program, we all used Eclipse as our IDE, so
it would likely work best in Eclipse, opening this directory.
You can likely also compile using the `javac` command on the 
command line on the `MovieDB.java` file.


The .java files can be found in the `src` directory.
The UML .ucls file can also be found in `src`; the image can be
	found in the `out\production\Project 1` directory.
The generated class files can be found in the 
	`out\production\Project 1` directory.
The `store` directory is for the generated `.dbf` files, but
	there were errors in the original implementation that we
	received and did not believe it was part of the project
	to fix it.
The Javadoc files are found in the `doc` directory.
